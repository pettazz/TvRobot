This module contains a set of methods that can be used for loading pages and
waiting for elements to come in.

The default option we use to search for elements is CSS Selector.
This can be changed by setting the by paramter.  The enum class for options is:
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

Options are
By.CSS_SELECTOR
By.CLASS_NAME
By.ID
By.NAME
By.LINK_TEXT
By.XPATH
By.TAG_NAME
By.PARTIAL_LINK_TEXT
